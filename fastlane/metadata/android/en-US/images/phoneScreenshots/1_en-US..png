<h1>This is an HTTP CONNECT tunnel, not an HTTP proxy.</h1>
<p>
It appears you have configured your web browser to use this Tor port as
an HTTP proxy.
</p><p>
This is not correct: This port is configured as a CONNECT tunnel, not
an HTTP proxy. Please configure your client accordingly.  You can also
use HTTPS; then the client should automatically use HTTP CONNECT.</p>
