<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Bodhi Timer is an elegant, minimalist countdown timer. It is designed mainly for use as a meditation timer but can easily be used for any similar purpose.</p>
<p>Set the time via the clock icon in the top left. You may set presets by choosing a time then holding down on one of the three preset buttons.</p>
<p>Pause / resume via the button in the bottom left, and stop the timer via the button in the bottom right. The top right button is the preference button.</p>
<p>You may add a timer widget to your desktop via the App Drawer, or on your lockscreen (Android 4.2+).</p>
<p>Animation may be toggled between an image and one of four circle animations, chosen from the preferences screen.</p>
<p>Bodhi Timer is based on the free and open source TeaTimer by Ralph Gootee:</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=goo.TeaTimer">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=goo.TeaTimer</a></p>
<p>It uses Android's built-in notification system to trigger the alarm, which means it works even when your device is asleep.</p>
